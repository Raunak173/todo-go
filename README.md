A basic todo app backend made using Golang and postgresSql as a Db. I used gin gonic and gorm with go.

This todo app has jwt authentication also, i.e all the routes of todo controller are protected.

JWT is set as a cookie

This is a ready to use backend, can be integrated to any frontend app, if i get time i will integrate it with a react native todo app
